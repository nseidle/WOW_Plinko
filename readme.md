Plinko exhibit for Kid's museum

A ball is dropped into the clear box. As it drops it hits a series of horizontal bars and falls down through one of six rings (red, green, orange, so on). The ball triggers a photo gate which causes the color of the box to change to the color of the ring the ball fell through.
